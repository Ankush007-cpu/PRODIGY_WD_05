# Weather Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is a **Weather Web Application** that fetches real-time weather data using a weather API. The application allows users to view current weather conditions based on their **geolocation** or a manually entered location.

## Features
- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieves real-time weather details from an API.
- **Location-Based Weather**: Detects user location using Geolocation API.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a city to get weather details.
- **Detailed Weather Info**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API requests, user input, and dynamic content updates.
- **Weather API**: Fetches real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).
